UI Rewrite:
    Expose move 'tags' which allow a move to be highlighted on the rendered board.
        - If a move has a tag going into the renderer, then all tiles placed by that move
          must keep that tag coming out.
        - This enables highlighting the hovered move, or rendering the current best move.
